**Mid-Year Self-Evaluation**

It‚Äôs been almost a year since I started my professional journey, and over the past few months, I‚Äôve been consistently working on the tasks and stories assigned to me. So far, I‚Äôve been a part of nearly **16 sprints** and have successfully completed and closed **33 stories**, all within the expected timelines. I‚Äôve made sure to update the progress regularly in Jira and reach out to the team whenever I needed support or clarification. I also ensured that each delivery met the quality expectations and was reviewed properly before closure.

### üß† Learning and Upskilling

Right after joining, I attended training sessions on **UI/UX** and **.NET** provided by the company. These sessions helped me understand the basics and gave me the confidence to start contributing to actual projects.

As part of the onboarding journey, I also took part in a **Code-a-thon**, where our team built a project called **"Text Finder and Masking Tool"** using ASP.NET. My role was focused on implementing the core logic and UI flow for identifying and masking selected text. Though we didn‚Äôt win, I learned a lot from working on this hands-on project and presenting it to the panel.

Apart from the mandatory training modules, I‚Äôve completed additional courses on **.NET** and **Angular** through **Degreed** and **O‚ÄôReilly**, which helped me strengthen my foundation. I also attended a **week-long advanced Angular workshop**, which went deeper into real-time use cases and hands-on coding.

Additionally, I enrolled in internal TFG courses on **Design Patterns** and **LLMs**, which helped broaden my understanding and exposed me to concepts I hadn‚Äôt worked with before.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering Excellence

As part of the **IRC to AP/AC transition**, I worked on identifying and fixing **SonarQube issues** such as bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities. I took time to understand each issue, went through the impacted logic, and applied clean and efficient fixes.

Along with this, I focused on **writing unit test cases** to cover different scenarios and edge cases. This helped improve the overall **test coverage** and ensured the stability of the code changes I made.

I also participated in the **FastTrack Co-Pilot sessions** conducted by Prakash. These sessions gave me exposure to how different teams approach technical problems and how internal tools and solutions are built and managed effectively.

---

### üí° Hackathons and Innovation

I participated in the **Hackathon for campus graduates**, where our team worked on an idea called **‚ÄúMeeting Topic Drift Monitor.‚Äù** This solution was aimed at tracking whether a meeting stays on topic or goes off-track. I worked on developing the **UI** and integrated it with the API created by the team.

This experience was fast-paced and collaborative, and it helped me think quickly and work efficiently under pressure. I also received a **HiFi award** from Nagaraj for my contribution to this project, which was a proud moment.

---

### ü§ù Organizational Involvement

I worked with **Kamal** on the **Startup Partnership initiative**, where I helped create a **pitch deck** for top private equity firms. This involved gathering data, designing content, and formatting slides to support investment conversations.

I‚Äôm also collaborating with **Vibhash and Prakash** on the **EDPP Educational Series**. We‚Äôre putting together technical content in a way that‚Äôs easy to follow and useful for the wider team.

During the **EDPP All Hands event**, I helped lead the **icebreaker session**, which turned out to be a fun and engaging way to start the session and get people involved.

---

### üå± Volunteering & CSR

I took part in company volunteering activities, including a **seed planting drive** and an **art and craft painting session** with school children. These events were refreshing and meaningful, and gave me the chance to contribute outside of work.

---

### üîê Security & Work Discipline

I make sure to **report all spam and phishing emails** to `abuse@bankofamerica.com` as part of maintaining security awareness.

I‚Äôve consistently followed the **Return-to-Office (RTO)** policy and come to the office **three days a week** as expected, without any misses or exceptions.

I‚Äôve also completed all **mandatory trainings and compliance modules** within the given timelines.

---

### üôå Recognition & Collaboration

I‚Äôve received multiple **e-cards** from colleagues for being helpful, responsive, and consistent in my work.

I also helped **organize games** during the **Chennai EDAD Gala**, which was a fun way to contribute and connect with others across teams.

---

**Closing Statement**

This journey so far has been filled with new challenges, teamwork, and opportunities to step up. I‚Äôve stayed committed to doing my part with sincerity and responsibility, and I‚Äôm proud of everything I‚Äôve been able to contribute in this time.

Thank you for the clarification! So:

* **IRC to AP & SE transition** is a **functional/feature-related migration** effort (from IRC to Epicenter).
* Fixing **SonarQube issues, test coverage, etc.** is part of **code quality/engineering improvement**.
* These need to be separated clearly in your evaluation.

Here‚Äôs the revised version with that correction and distinction:

### üîÑ IRC to AP & SE Transition

I have been actively involved in the **IRC to AP & SE transition**, which focuses on moving functionality from the IRC platform to **Epicenter**. As part of this, I worked on ensuring a smooth transition for data and feature mapping.

The **data movement** between platforms has been tested and is functioning successfully. I‚Äôve been part of reviewing existing flows, adapting them to new systems, and validating the accuracy of this transition.

This work required strong attention to detail and cross-checking to avoid any mismatch or disruption in ongoing business processes.
