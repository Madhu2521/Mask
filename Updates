Once an alternate manager is selected while creating a request, there is no option in the dropdown to revert it back to NULL if the requestor decides not to add an alternate manager's name.
Additionally, if the requestor manually enters an override expiration date and types any past date, the system automatically sets the date to today's date. This behavior should be modified so that the automatically set date is one year from the current date.
While creating a new request, near the file attachment option, the wording says, "**!Attach the files if asked by BA**." This should be changed because, at the time of creating a request, the BA would not have requested anything yet.
If a request is submitted, the message displayed as "Request Submitted" is vague and only appears for a few seconds. It would be better if it were displayed more clearly, such as in a popup, along with the request ID for better visibility.
When a requestor wants to delete a request from the queue and clicks the delete button, it would be better if a confirmation message, such as **"Are you sure you want to delete this request? (Request ID: XXXX)"**, is displayed. This will help prevent accidental deletions.
It would also be better to have a record of deleted requests, including the **request ID** and the **user who deleted it**. This would help track deletions and prevent any unintended loss of requests
When a requestor tries to add more information upon request from the BA or manager, the expiration date option is still enabled. This allows them to change the expiration date to a different one than the originally submitted date. To prevent this, the expiration date field should be disabled during this stage.
It would be better if, when the requestor is asked to provide more information by the manager or BA, they have a **textbox** to add comments explaining the information they are submitting. This would provide better clarity and context for the update.
When a request is updated by the manager or BA, it should automatically redirect them back to the queue page after displaying a message—such as a popup—confirming the update, along with the **request ID** (e.g., **"Request [ID] updated successfully"**). This would improve the user experience by providing confirmation and seamless navigation.
1. When a request is updated by the manager or BA, a confirmation message—such as a popup—should be displayed, including the **request ID**, to indicate that the request has been successfully updated.  

2. After displaying the confirmation message, the system should automatically redirect the user back to the **queue page** for a smoother workflow.
When an invalid Standard ID is entered and the request is submitted, the warning popup currently says, **"The NSID is not available."** The wording would be more appropriate if it said, **"The NSID is not valid."**
